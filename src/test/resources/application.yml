bdd-for-all:
  request:
    server:
      ## REALLY IMPORTANT!!!!!
      ## the server to execute requests against
      host: "http://localhost:8181"
    ## the user agent sent over in the headers
    ## good for debugging and tracing in your remote apps
    userAgent: "ACN-BDD-CUCUMBER"
    ## the name of the transaction id sent in the headers
    correlationIdName: "X-Correlation-ID"
    defaults:
      ## array of custom headers
      headers:
        - "X-Made-Up-Header1": "Header Value 1"
        - "From": "tester@example.com"
  ## alternative contexts
  ## so instead of saying - Given I am a JSON API consumer -
  ## you can say things like - Given I'm a "Mobile device" -
  ## and map it to a known consumer (e.g. JSON)
  consumers:
    - "Mobile device": JSON
  ## custom variables that will be available to you in your
  ## feature files
  vars:
    User:
      Name:
        First: Mike
  ## The rest assured configuration
  ## You don't need this, as these are the defaults
  http:
    connection:
      managerTimeout: 10000
      requestTimeout: 10000
      socketTimeout: 10000
  ## directly sets the cucumber properties, to see what else
  ## you can set https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/main/junit-platform-engine/src/main/java/io/cucumber/junit/platform/engine/Constants.java
  cucumber:
    ## Could be anything you want, doesn't impact BDD For all processing
    ## important for on screen messaging and reporting
    ## see https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/reporting/ for more
    plugin: "pretty, json:target/cucumber/primary-cucumber.json"
    ## We leave this here, so you can add your own processors
    ## at the very least you need the com.accenture.testing.bdd.api.steps
    ## for this to work
    glue: "com.accenture.testing.bdd.api.steps"
    ## This is the path to the feature files to execute
    ## Could pass in through code as well
    features: "src/test/resources/features"
    ## keeps that annoying message off screen
    ## around publisher
    publish:
      quiet: true
    ## fails on undefined steps
    execution:
      strict: true
