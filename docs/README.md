No longer do your business, development and testing teams need to translate each others requirements and reports into something else to do their job.  This natural language, [behavior-driven development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) library exists to simplify the documenting of requirements and the testing of your API's.

## Overview & Setup

Check out [our project page on GitHub](https://github.com/Accenture/bdd-for-all/) for an overview while we get this site updated.

## Using

For an overview on using cucumber, feature files and more, we highly recommend the [10 Minute Tutorial](https://docs.cucumber.io/guides/10-minute-tutorial/) from cucumber.io.

The following documentation explains our particular implementation of BDD using Cucumber and some of the advanced features the library provides...

* [Step Definitions (Grammar)](GRAMMAR.md)
* [Chaining Responses (Workflows)](CHAINING.md)
* [Data Generation (and variables)](DATAGEN.md)
* [Scenarios](SCENARIOS.md)
* [Advanced Expressions](GPATH.md)
* [Other Cool Features](OTHERFEATURES.md)
* [Reporting](REPORTING.md)
* [Configuration & Logging](CONFIGURATION.md)

Also, don't forget. Check out the [contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to contribute or the [BDD for All](../README.md) overview if you missed it.
